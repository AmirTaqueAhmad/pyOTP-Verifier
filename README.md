# pyOTP-Verifier
 pyOTP-Verifier is a Python project that generates &amp; verifies secure One-Time Passwords (OTP). It uses random digits to create a 6-digit OTP, sent via email through a secure SMTP connection. Enhance your app's security with this easy-to-use OTP solution.

 # Description
 pyOTP-Verifier is a robust and versatile Python-based project designed to enhance security by providing a seamless and reliable mechanism for generating and verifying One-Time Passwords (OTP). OTPs have become a fundamental part of modern authentication systems, offering an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access and ensuring data confidentiality.

With the increasing demand for secure authentication methods, pyOTP-Verifier offers a straightforward and efficient solution for implementing OTP functionality in various applications. The project's core functionality revolves around generating a random 6-digit OTP using a combination of digits "0123456789." This OTP is then sent to the user's specified email address through a secure Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) connection.

The process begins by utilizing Python's built-in random and math modules to generate a strong and unpredictable OTP. The user's email address is obtained via a user-friendly input prompt, ensuring a seamless and interactive experience. The generated OTP is then concatenated with a personalized message, which includes essential information such as the purpose of the OTP and the application name (e.g., "Azibo").

To ensure utmost security during communication, pyOTP-Verifier establishes a secure connection with Gmail's SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com), using the industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol on port 587. The project offers peace of mind, knowing that the generated OTP is securely transmitted to the user's email, protecting it from potential interception by malicious actors.

Once the OTP is dispatched, pyOTP-Verifier enters a verification loop, prompting the user to enter the received OTP. The application meticulously compares the user-provided OTP with the previously generated one. If the OTPs match, the system confirms the successful verification, granting access to the authenticated user. Conversely, if the OTPs do not align, the user is requested to attempt the verification process again, ensuring the highest level of accuracy and security.

pyOTP-Verifier caters to various scenarios where robust authentication is essential, such as user registration, password recovery, and critical transaction approvals. The project's versatility allows developers to seamlessly integrate OTP functionality into their applications, safeguarding sensitive information and bolstering user trust.

In summary, pyOTP-Verifier stands as a powerful and user-friendly OTP generation and verification system, empowering developers to implement secure authentication mechanisms and protect their applications from potential security threats.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Creating pyOTP-Verifier - Secure One-Time Password Generation and Verification
Step 1: Import Required Libraries
Import the necessary libraries for the project: os, math, random, and smtplib.

Step 2: Define Digit Set
Create a string variable named digits containing "0123456789." This set of digits will be used to generate the OTP.

Step 3: Generate OTP
Use a loop to generate a 6-digit OTP. For each iteration, select a random digit from the digits set and append it to the OTP variable.

Step 4: Compose Email Message
Add a personalized message to the OTP, indicating its purpose and application name (e.g., "Azibo").

Step 5: Connect to SMTP Server
Establish a connection to Gmail's SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com) on port 587 using smtplib.SMTP and enable TLS encryption with s.starttls() for secure communication.

Step 6: Authenticate with Gmail
Login to the sender's Gmail account using the s.login() method with the Gmail address and the corresponding application-specific password.

Step 7: Accept User's Email Input
Prompt the user to input their email address where the OTP will be sent.

Step 8: Send OTP via Email
Use s.sendmail() to send the OTP message to the user's provided email address.

Step 9: OTP Verification Loop
Set up a while loop to prompt the user to enter the OTP they received via email.

Step 10: Verify OTP
Compare the user's input with the generated OTP. If they match, print "OTP is Verified" and break out of the loop. Otherwise, print "Please Try Again" and repeat the loop until the OTP is successfully verified.

Step 11: Project Summary
Summarize pyOTP-Verifier's purpose as a secure Python-based OTP generation and verification project, enhancing application security with its user-friendly and efficient authentication mechanism.

# Generate App Password
To get a Gmail key or application-specific password, you need to generate it through your Google account settings. Application-specific passwords are used to grant specific applications access to your Gmail account without giving them your main account password. This provides an additional layer of security. Follow the steps below to obtain a Gmail key:

Step 1: Go to Google Account Settings
Visit the Google Account website (https://myaccount.google.com/) and sign in to your Gmail account.

Step 2: Navigate to Security Settings
Once logged in, click on "Security" in the left-hand navigation menu.

Step 3: Find "Signing in to Google"
Scroll down to the "Signing in to Google" section and click on "App passwords." You may need to verify your identity by entering your account password again.

Step 4: Select App & Device
Choose the app and device for which you want to generate the application-specific password. In this case, you might select "Mail" as the app and the relevant device.

Step 5: Generate App Password
Click on "Generate" to create an application-specific password. Google will generate a unique password for the selected app and device.

Step 6: Save the App Password
Google will display a randomly generated 16-character password. Copy this password and keep it in a safe place, as you won't be able to see it again. Note that you will use this application-specific password in your Python code when connecting to Gmail's SMTP server.

Please remember that you should keep application-specific passwords secure and not share them with others. Each app and device combination can have a different app password, so you can create separate passwords for different applications that need access to your Gmail account.
